# GAIA V7 - Dynamic Workflows Design Document

## Overview
GAIA V7 introduces dynamic workflows and iterative reasoning, allowing GAIA to solve complex multi-step problems through recursive processing and adaptive context management.

## Core Features

### 1. Iterative Reasoning Loops
- **Multi-step problem decomposition**: Break complex queries into sub-tasks
- **Recursive refinement**: Iterate on responses until quality threshold met
- **Self-evaluation**: Check if response adequately addresses the query
- **Backtracking**: Ability to revise earlier steps if needed

### 2. Dynamic Context Management
- **Working memory**: Separate short-term memory for current task
- **Context stack**: Push/pop contexts for nested reasoning
- **Relevance filtering**: Dynamically adjust what patterns to consider
- **Memory consolidation**: Move important findings to long-term patterns

### 3. Transformer-like Processing
- **Self-attention mechanism**: Without matrices, using pattern relevance
- **Multi-head reasoning**: Parallel reasoning paths that merge
- **Positional encoding**: Track reasoning step order
- **Layer normalization**: Balance different reasoning paths

### 4. Multi-Step Workflows
- **Task planning**: Decompose complex requests into steps
- **Step execution**: Process each step with full GAIA capabilities
- **Progress tracking**: Monitor completion of sub-tasks
- **Result synthesis**: Combine sub-results into coherent response

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
```c
typedef struct {
    char description[256];
    int completed;
    char result[512];
    float confidence;
} ReasoningStep;

typedef struct {
    ReasoningStep steps[MAX_STEPS];
    int num_steps;
    int current_step;
    char working_memory[WORKING_MEMORY_SIZE];
} WorkflowState;
```

### Phase 2: Iterative Engine
- Implement reasoning loop controller
- Add self-evaluation functions
- Create backtracking mechanism
- Build confidence scoring

### Phase 3: Context Management
- Implement context stack
- Add relevance filtering
- Create memory consolidation
- Build dynamic pattern selection

### Phase 4: Integration
- Connect to V6 analysis functions
- Integrate with pattern matching
- Add experiment logging
- Create comprehensive tests

## Example Use Cases

### Complex Math Word Problem
```
Input: "If John has 3 apples and gives half to Mary, then Mary gives 2 apples to Bob, how many apples does each person have?"

V7 Process:
1. Parse entities: John (3), Mary (0), Bob (0)
2. Step 1: John gives half (1.5) to Mary
3. Update: John (1.5), Mary (1.5), Bob (0)
4. Step 2: Mary gives 2 to Bob (ERROR: Mary only has 1.5)
5. Backtrack and re-evaluate
6. Final answer with explanation
```

### Multi-Part Question
```
Input: "What is the capital of France, what's its population, and name three famous landmarks there?"

V7 Process:
1. Decompose into 3 sub-questions
2. Answer each using different capabilities
3. Synthesize into coherent response
```

### Iterative Refinement
```
Input: "Explain quantum computing simply"

V7 Process:
1. Generate initial explanation
2. Self-evaluate: Too technical?
3. Simplify iteratively
4. Check coherence and completeness
5. Deliver refined explanation
```

## Success Metrics
- Multi-step problem solving accuracy
- Iteration efficiency (avg steps to solution)
- Context management performance
- Workflow completion rate
- Response quality improvement

## Testing Strategy
1. Unit tests for each component
2. Integration tests for workflows
3. Complex problem test suite
4. Performance benchmarks
5. Quality evaluation metrics
