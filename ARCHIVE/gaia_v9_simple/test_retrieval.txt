Test scenarios for improved fact retrieval:

1. Store a fact: "Python is a programming language"
   Query variations:
   - "What is Python?"
   - "Tell me about Python"
   - "python" (lowercase)
   - "programming language"

2. Store user fact: "My favorite color is blue"
   Query variations:
   - "What's my favorite color?"
   - "favorite color"
   - "Tell me my favorite"
   - "What do you remember about my favorites?"

3. Store multiple facts:
   - "The sky is blue"
   - "Water is wet"
   - "Fire is hot"
   Query: "Tell me about water"

4. Pattern matching:
   First interaction: "How are you?" -> "I'm doing well, thank you!"
   Later query: "How are you doing?"
