# gaia + Kubernetes: Distributed Intelligence at Scale

## Core Concept

Gates as microservices. Networks as deployments. Intelligence as infrastructure.

## Architecture

```yaml
apiVersion: gaia.tech/v1
kind: GateNetwork
metadata:
  name: text-processor
spec:
  gates:
    - name: input-layer
      type: BUFFER
      replicas: 100
    - name: pattern-matcher
      type: PATTERN
      replicas: 50
    - name: decision-layer
      type: THRESHOLD
      replicas: 10
  connections:
    - from: input-layer
      to: pattern-matcher
      loadBalancer: round-robin
    - from: pattern-matcher
      to: decision-layer
      loadBalancer: hash-based
```

## Instant URL Resolution

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: gaia-endpoints
spec:
  rules:
    - http:
        paths:
        - path: /compute/*
          backend:
            service:
              name: gaia-router
              port: 
                number: 8080
```

Router service:
```c
// Inside container
void handle(request_t* req) {
    uint32_t gate_addr = hash(req->path);
    pod_ip = kubernetes_endpoints[gate_addr % num_pods];
    forward_to_pod(pod_ip, req);
}
```

## Scalability Patterns

### Horizontal Scaling
```bash
# Scale specific gate types based on load
kubectl scale deployment pattern-gates --replicas=1000

# Autoscale based on computation metrics
kubectl autoscale deployment threshold-gates \
  --min=10 --max=10000 --cpu-percent=80
```

### Network Sharding
```yaml
# Split large networks across namespaces
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: gaia-shard-1
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: gaia-shard-2
```

## Policy-Driven Intelligence

```yaml
apiVersion: gaia.tech/v1
kind: LearningPolicy
metadata:
  name: adaptive-routing
spec:
  updateInterval: 100ms
  gates:
    selector:
      type: ADAPTIVE_AND
  training:
    mode: continuous
    feedback: external
  persistence:
    enabled: true
    storage: configmap
```

## ConfigMaps as Neural State

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: gate-weights
data:
  threshold-01: "0.7,0.3,0.9,0.1"
  pattern-memory: "101:1,110:0,011:1"
  adaptive-state: "confidence:0.85"
```

## Service Mesh Integration

```yaml
# Istio for intelligent routing between gates
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: gate-routing
spec:
  http:
  - match:
    - headers:
        compute-type:
          exact: high-priority
    route:
    - destination:
        host: threshold-gates
        subset: gpu-enabled
```

## Distributed Training

```yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: distributed-learning
spec:
  parallelism: 100
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: gate-trainer
        image: gaia:latest
        command: ["train", "--distributed"]
        env:
        - name: GATE_TYPE
          value: "PATTERN"
        - name: TRAINING_DATA
          valueFrom:
            configMapKeyRef:
              name: training-sets
              key: dataset-1
```

## Observability

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: gate-metrics
  labels:
    prometheus.io/scrape: "true"
spec:
  ports:
  - name: metrics
    port: 9090
```

Metrics exposed:
- Gate evaluation latency
- Network throughput
- Learning convergence rates
- Pattern recognition accuracy

## Benefits

1. **Linear Scaling**: Add pods = add intelligence
2. **Fault Tolerance**: Dead gates auto-restart
3. **A/B Testing**: Deploy competing networks
4. **GitOps**: Intelligence as code
5. **Multi-Region**: Geographically distributed cognition

## Example: API Gateway

```yaml
# Every API endpoint is a gate network
apiVersion: gaia.tech/v1
kind: EndpointGate
metadata:
  name: user-api
spec:
  routes:
    - path: /users/*
      gate: user-handler
      computed: true  # O(1) routing
    - path: /orders/*
      gate: order-processor
      computed: true
```

## The Paradigm Shift

Not deploying applications. Deploying intelligence.
Not managing containers. Managing consciousness.
Not scaling services. Scaling synapses.

Kubernetes becomes the nervous system. gaia provides the neurons.
