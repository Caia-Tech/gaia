# GAIA V7 - Dynamic Workflows & Iterative Reasoning

## Overview
GAIA V7 introduces dynamic workflows and multi-step reasoning capabilities, building on V6's analysis functions to create a more sophisticated reasoning system.

## Key Features

### 1. Dynamic Workflow Engine
- **Query Decomposition**: Breaks complex queries into manageable steps
- **Step Types**: DECOMPOSE, ANALYZE, EXECUTE, EVALUATE, SYNTHESIZE, BACKTRACK, COMPLETE
- **Iterative Processing**: Each step can be retried and refined
- **Confidence Tracking**: Each step has a confidence score

### 2. Multi-Step Reasoning
- **Multi-part Questions**: Automatically detects and handles multiple sub-questions
- **Calculation Workflows**: Extract numbers → Execute → Verify
- **Explanation Workflows**: Understand concept → Generate explanation → Check clarity
- **List Generation**: Identify requirements → Generate items → Format response

### 3. Context Management
- **Context Stack**: Push/pop contexts for nested reasoning
- **Working Memory**: 4KB buffer for intermediate results
- **Relevance Filtering**: Focus on relevant patterns per context

### 4. Quality Assurance
- **Response Quality Scoring**: Evaluates length, relevance, keyword matching
- **Backtracking**: Revise previous steps if confidence is low
- **Iteration Limits**: Prevents infinite loops

### 5. Integration with V6
- **Analysis Functions**: Uses V6's prompt/entity analysis
- **Response Formatting**: Leverages V6's formatting helpers
- **Function Registry**: Accesses registered mathematical functions
- **Experiment Logging**: Tracks workflow executions

## Implementation Details

### Core Files
- `dynamic_workflows.h`: Workflow structures and function declarations
- `dynamic_workflows.c`: Implementation of workflow engine
- `gaia_chat_v7.c`: Integration with chat system

### Key Functions
```c
// Create and manage workflows
WorkflowState* create_workflow(void);
int decompose_query(WorkflowState* workflow, const char* input);
int execute_workflow(WorkflowState* workflow);
char* synthesize_results(WorkflowState* workflow);

// Step execution
int execute_reasoning_step(WorkflowState* workflow);
int evaluate_step_result(WorkflowState* workflow, int step_index);

// Quality control
float calculate_response_quality(const char* query, const char* response);
int should_backtrack(WorkflowState* workflow);
int perform_backtrack(WorkflowState* workflow);
```

### Workflow Structure
```c
typedef struct {
    ReasoningStep steps[MAX_REASONING_STEPS];
    int num_steps;
    int current_step;
    char working_memory[WORKING_MEMORY_SIZE];
    ContextFrame context_stack[MAX_CONTEXT_DEPTH];
    int context_depth;
    float overall_confidence;
    int total_iterations;
    int backtrack_count;
} WorkflowState;
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```bash
./gaia_chat_v7
You: What is 5 plus 3?
GAIA V7: 5 plus 3 = 8
```

### Multi-part Questions
```bash
You: What is 15 plus 27? Also, can you explain what addition means?
GAIA V7: 15 plus 27 = 42 Addition is a mathematical operation that combines two or more numbers to get their total sum.
```

### Debug Mode
```bash
./gaia_chat_v7 --debug-workflows
You: What is 2 plus 2?
[Workflow] Decomposed into 5 steps
[Step 1] Extract mathematical elements
  Output: 2 plus 2 = 4
...
```

### Command Line Options
- `--debug-workflows`: Enable workflow debugging output
- `--no-workflows`: Disable workflows (fallback to V6 behavior)
- `--superposition`: Enable superposition mode
- `--no-analysis`: Disable analysis functions

### Interactive Commands
- `toggle-workflows`: Enable/disable workflows
- `toggle-debug`: Enable/disable debug output
- `workflow-test`: Run built-in workflow test
- `stats`: Show system statistics
- `log-summary`: Show experiment summary
- `save-experiments`: Save experiment log

## Test Results
- Workflow unit tests: 88.9% pass rate (8/9 tests)
- Integration tests: Successfully handling multi-part questions
- Edge cases: Proper error handling for division by zero

## Future Enhancements (V8-V10)
- **V8**: Transformer architecture with self-attention
- **V9**: Distributed reasoning across multiple agents
- **V10**: Meta-learning and self-improvement

## Known Limitations
1. Quality evaluation test has strict thresholds for short responses
2. Some duplicate outputs in simple queries (cosmetic issue)
3. Explanation generation is currently template-based

## Conclusion
V7 successfully implements dynamic workflows and multi-step reasoning, providing a foundation for more advanced reasoning capabilities in future versions. The system can decompose complex queries, execute them step-by-step, and synthesize coherent responses.
