# What Can 8 Gates Actually Do?

## Test Results

We tested 8-gate networks with 4 gate types: PASS, NOT, MEMORY, XOR_WITH_MEMORY

### ✓ Problems Solved

1. **XOR** (130 generations)
   - Classic non-linear problem
   - Required cascading NOT and XOR_MEM gates

2. **3-bit Parity** (659 generations)  
   - Count odd number of 1s in 3 bits
   - Harder than XOR but still solvable
   - Essentially chained XOR operations

3. **Sequence Detection '101'** (0 generations!)
   - Detect pattern in bit stream
   - Memory gates made this trivial
   - Shows strength of stateful gates

4. **Basic Logic Gates** (partial)
   - AND/OR mostly worked (6/8 score)
   - Simple boolean functions

### ✗ Problems Failed

1. **2-bit Addition** (best: 9/16)
   - Requires carry propagation
   - 8 gates insufficient for full adder logic
   - Would need ~12-16 gates

## Key Insights

1. **Memory gates are powerful** - Solved sequence detection instantly
2. **Non-linearity is achievable** - XOR and parity both work
3. **Carry chains need more gates** - Addition fails at current scale
4. **Evolution finds surprising solutions** - Gate arrangements weren't obvious

## The 8-Gate Limit

8 gates can handle:
- Single-bit outputs
- Problems requiring up to 3-4 decision boundaries  
- Simple temporal patterns
- Basic boolean logic

8 gates cannot handle:
- Multi-bit arithmetic
- Complex state machines
- Long-range dependencies

## Next Steps

Rather than scaling up, we could:
1. Try different gate types (delays, oscillators)
2. Allow recurrent connections
3. Test on continuous functions
4. Explore minimal solutions for each problem
