# GAIA V10 Pure - Gate-Based Intelligence

## Philosophy

After 9 versions of increasing complexity, we returned to first principles:
- Intelligence emerges from simple transformations
- Gates that transform signals, not strings
- Learning through adaptation, not memorization

## What's Here

### Core Implementations

1. **gaia_pure.c** (175 lines)
   - Basic gate network with 4 types: identity, amplify, sigmoid, threshold
   - Attempts to learn XOR pattern
   - Demonstrates memory gates

2. **gaia_minimal.c** (106 lines)
   - Minimal implementation with just 8 gates
   - Each gate function is one line
   - Shows that complexity isn't required

3. **gaia_emergence.c** (185 lines)
   - Evolution-based learning instead of backpropagation
   - 16 gates self-organize through mutations
   - Solves parity detection problem

### Testing

- **test_gates.c** - Comprehensive test suite
- **test_results.md** - Honest assessment of what works

## Key Concepts

### Gate Types

```c
// Pass-through with weight
float g_pass(float x, Gate* g) { return x * g->w; }

// Amplifier with saturation
float g_amp(float x, Gate* g) { return tanh(x * g->w * 2); }

// Memory with decay
float g_mem(float x, Gate* g) { return (g->m = g->m * 0.8 + x * 0.2) * g->w; }

// Binary threshold
float g_thresh(float x, Gate* g) { return x * g->w > 0.5 ? 1.0 : -1.0; }
```

### Learning Approaches

1. **Gradient-based** - Adjust weights based on error
2. **Evolution** - Random mutations, keep improvements
3. **Hebbian** - Strengthen connections that fire together

## Results

- Single gates can learn linear functions ✓
- Memory gates maintain state ✓
- Threshold gates make decisions ✓
- Complex problems (XOR) need better architectures ⚠️

## Build & Run

```bash
make              # Build all
./gaia_pure       # Run basic version
./gaia_minimal    # Run minimal version
./gaia_emergence  # Run evolution demo
./test_gates      # Run tests
```

## Lessons Learned

1. **Simplicity enables understanding** - 100 lines > 5000 lines
2. **Real learning requires real computation** - Not string matching
3. **Architecture matters** - Random gates don't solve problems
4. **Evolution finds solutions** - Sometimes better than gradient descent

## Future Directions

- Explore different gate types (oscillators, delays, filters)
- Better learning rules (Hebbian, STDP)
- Principled architectures (not random connections)
- Hybrid approaches (evolution + gradient descent)

## The Bottom Line

V10 is the most honest version of GAIA. It doesn't pretend to understand language or have conversations. It's just gates learning to transform signals - which is what intelligence might actually be.
