# gaia Text Processing: Comprehensive Plan

## Objective
Build text understanding and generation using only logic gates, proving that language models don't require matrices or transformers.

## Core Architecture

### Phase 1: Character Encoding (Week 1)
```c
// Each ASCII character = 8-bit pattern = 8 gates
typedef struct {
    Gate* bits[8];  // One gate per bit
    char character;
} CharacterGate;
```

**Tasks:**
1. Map ASCII to gate states (A=01000001 → 8 gates)
2. Build character recognition circuits
3. Create character output networks
4. Test full ASCII range

### Phase 2: Word Detection (Week 2)
```c
// Word boundaries = pattern detection
typedef struct {
    Gate* space_detector;    // Detects 0x20
    Gate* punctuation_check; // Detects .,!?
    Gate* word_accumulator;  // Builds words
} WordBoundaryDetector;
```

**Tasks:**
1. Space/punctuation detection circuits
2. Word accumulation buffers
3. Variable-length word handling
4. Word completion signals

### Phase 3: Pattern Matching (Week 3)
```c
// Common words as gate patterns
typedef struct {
    char* word;
    Gate* pattern_gates[MAX_WORD_LENGTH];
    Gate* match_output;
} WordPattern;
```

**Tasks:**
1. Build patterns for top 1000 words
2. Parallel pattern matching
3. Confidence scoring
4. Unknown word handling

### Phase 4: Tokenization (Week 4)
```c
// Token = recognized unit
typedef struct {
    enum { WORD, NUMBER, PUNCT, UNKNOWN } type;
    Gate* type_classifier;
    Gate* token_storage[MAX_TOKEN_SIZE];
} Token;
```

**Tasks:**
1. Token type classification
2. Token boundary detection
3. Token sequence building
4. Special token handling

### Phase 5: Context Building (Week 5)
```c
// Context = token relationships
typedef struct {
    Token* tokens[CONTEXT_WINDOW];
    Gate* attention_gates[CONTEXT_WINDOW][CONTEXT_WINDOW];
    Gate* context_summary;
} Context;
```

**Tasks:**
1. Sliding context windows
2. Token relationship detection
3. Context summarization
4. Long-range dependencies

### Phase 6: Response Generation (Week 6)
```c
// Generate text from context
typedef struct {
    Context* input_context;
    Gate* generation_network;
    CharacterGate* output_buffer[MAX_RESPONSE];
} ResponseGenerator;
```

**Tasks:**
1. Context-to-pattern mapping
2. Word selection logic
3. Grammar rule circuits
4. Coherence checking

## Technical Approach

### Character Processing
```
Input: "Hello"
H → 01001000 → [0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0] gates
e → 01100101 → [0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1] gates
...
```

### Word Recognition
```
Accumulated: [H,e,l,l,o]
Pattern match: "Hello" → confidence 1.0
Output: WORD_TOKEN("Hello")
```

### Context Understanding
```
Tokens: ["What", "is", "your", "name", "?"]
Relations: 
  "What" → "?" (question pattern)
  "your" → "name" (possession pattern)
Response trigger: QUESTION_ABOUT_IDENTITY
```

## Memory Architecture

### Short-term (Working Memory)
- Current sentence buffer
- Active token window
- Immediate context

### Long-term (Pattern Storage)
- Learned word patterns
- Common phrases
- Response templates

## Learning Mechanisms

### Online Learning
- Adjust pattern confidence based on usage
- Learn new word patterns
- Adapt response strategies

### Batch Learning
- Process text corpus
- Extract common patterns
- Build frequency tables

## Performance Targets

- Character recognition: < 1μs per char
- Word detection: < 10μs per word
- Token generation: < 100μs per token
- Response generation: < 1ms per word

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
1. Character encoding/decoding
2. Word boundary detection
3. Pattern matching accuracy
4. Token classification

### Integration Tests
1. Full sentence processing
2. Multi-sentence context
3. Question answering
4. Text completion

### Benchmarks
1. Compare with regex performance
2. Memory usage vs string operations
3. Scaling with text length
4. Parallel processing gains

## Example Implementation Flow

```
Input: "What is gaia?"

1. Character encoding:
   'W' → [0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1]
   'h' → [0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0]
   ...

2. Word detection:
   "What" (space detected)
   "is" (space detected)
   "gaia" (? detected)

3. Token creation:
   [WORD:"What", WORD:"is", WORD:"gaia", PUNCT:"?"]

4. Context analysis:
   Question pattern detected
   Subject: "gaia"
   Query type: definition

5. Response generation:
   Template: "X is Y"
   X = "gaia"
   Y = lookup("gaia") → "logic gate based AI"

6. Output encoding:
   "gaia is logic gate based AI"
   → Character gates → Output

```

## Advantages Over Traditional NLP

1. **Deterministic**: Same input → same output
2. **Explainable**: Trace exact gate path
3. **Efficient**: No matrix multiplication
4. **Scalable**: Add gates for capacity
5. **Modular**: Swap components easily

## Next Steps

1. Implement Phase 1 character encoding
2. Build test harness for gate networks
3. Create visualization tools
4. Begin pattern library
5. Design learning loops

This approach proves text processing is pattern matching, not statistics.
